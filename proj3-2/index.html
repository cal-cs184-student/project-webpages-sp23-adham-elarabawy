        Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image.
        Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all
        screenshots.
      </b></p>
    <p>
      Zero bounce (m = 0) rendering only shows the surface source light. One bounce (m = 1) shows the walls, but also
      the reflection on the spheres. However,
      the spheres are still mostly black, with the refractive sphere having a more noisy reflection due to incident
      light. Two bounces enables the
      reflective sphere to begin reflecting the scene because with m = 2, the rays can hit both the sphere and the light
      of the room. In this case,
      the refractive sphere does not refract since the ray uses both bounces to enter the sphere and then leave the
      sphere. When m = 3, then we can
      start to see the refraction in the spheres because the ray also moves into the room, therefore the sphere is not
      that black anymore. With m = 4,
      the reflective sphere's reflection of the refractive sphere is a dab of light onto the blue wall. As the number of
      bounces is increased to m = 5
      and m = 100, there is not much visible difference in the renderings besides the top half of the refractive sphere
      getting a little lighter.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2. Microfacet Material</h3>
    <p><b>
        Show a screenshot sequence of 4 images of scene `CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae` rendered with $\alpha$ set to
        0.005, 0.05, 0.25 and 0.5. The other settings should be at least 128 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light.
        The number of bounces should be at least 5. Describe the differences between different images. Note that, to
        change the $\alpha$, just open the .dae file and search for `microfacet`.
      </b></p>
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr align="center">

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      When alpha increases, more diffusion occurs, which simultaneously makes the object look less like a mirror and
      more like a diffuse surface. Therefore, the very small alphas look quite mirror-like and reflective, and the very
      high walphas look very diffuse.

        Show two images of scene `CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae` rendered using cosine hemisphere sampling (default) and
        your importance sampling. The sampling rate should be fixed at 64 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The
        number of bounces should be at least 5. Briefly discuss their difference.
      </b></p>
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr align="center">
        <td>
          <img src="images/pt2/bunny_cosine_hemisphere.png" align="middle" width="600px" />

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      In cosine sampling, we randomly sample across the hemisphere of reflection, which results in many light rays of ~0
      radiance, resulting in our bunny looking darker (and more samples are noisy/0). Utilizing importance sampling,
      which concentrates the samples on the lobe of light reflection based on the MicroFacet material properites,
      results in much better reflections and sampling over the object!
